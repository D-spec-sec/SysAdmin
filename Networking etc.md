InfiniBand is known for its low-latency and high-throughput characteristics, making it a suitable choice when rapid access to remote memory across a network is required. Its design, including features like Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), allows for efficient communication with remote memory locations. InfiniBand is often used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments and scenarios where low latency is crucial.


FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet): FCoE is a protocol that encapsulates Fibre Channel frames within Ethernet packets. While it provides a way to carry Fibre Channel traffic over Ethernet networks, it may not offer the same level of low-latency and high-throughput performance as InfiniBand.

SWAN (Storage Wide Area Network): SWAN is not a specific protocol and is not commonly associated with rapid access to remote memory. It seems to be a term not directly related to the specified networking requirements.

Ethernet: While Ethernet is a widely used and standard networking protocol, it may not provide the same level of low-latency performance as InfiniBand, especially in scenarios where rapid access to remote memory is a primary requirement.
Ethernet has made advancements with technologies like Remote Direct Memory Access over Converged Ethernet (RoCE), but InfiniBand is often preferred for extremely low-latency applications.
